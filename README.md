Learning to code

Hi There.

My name is Samuel, I'am 17 years old and i've been studying python for three months. It's my first language and i would like to share my progression with you.
And if you want, you can help a how to code better. Sorry, for my english, i'am learning yet.

Here, i'll explain my tasks for you.


Ex01:

My duty here was, create a matrix 4x4 and put the number on it, the lesson don't specified if was manually or not. I made with library random,
but if i wanted to make manually, in the line 6 i could replace "random.choice(numbers)" for an input.

Ex02:

Here i create a matrix 4x4 too, but i wanted to make a vertical line with number 1 on matrix, all other numbers should have a value 0.
My logic was, all the vertical positions have coluns and lines with the same values, exemple: position[0,0] it's the first one, position[1,1], it's the second.
And successively, to get this i made a verification: if line = column so this is a vertical, else, this is not a vertical. 

Ex03:
