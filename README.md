Learning to code

Hi There.

My name is Samuel, I'am 17 years old and i've been studying python for three months. It's my first language and i would like to share my progression with you.
And if you want, you can help a how to code better. Sorry, for my english, i'am learning yet.

Here, i'll explain my tasks for you.


Ex01:

My duty here was, create a matrix 4x4 and put the number on it, the lesson don't specified if was manually or not. I made with library random,
but if i wanted to make manually, in the line 6 i could replace "random.choice(numbers)" for an input.

Ex02:

Here, i create a matrix 4x4 too, but i wanted to make a vertical line with number 1 on matrix, all other numbers should have a value 0.
My logic was, all the vertical positions have coluns and lines with the same values, example: position[0,0] it's the first one, position[1,1], it's the second.
And successively, to get this i made a verification: if line = column so this is a vertical, else, this is not a vertical. 

Ex03:

The third one, i had to make a matrix 10x10 and to make a normal problem matrix, if i < j = ....  was simple.

Ex04:

This one was more difficult, i had to sum all values above of main vertical, my logic was, get the four numbers next to vertical (one number was inside of the vertical) and subtract the number of the vertical. In my opinion this was my worst code, i didn't like my logic but i don't know another better.

Ex05:

Basically, i had to make a program that register how many money the company will pay to a contributiners with a allowance, and the alloawance will be 20% of pay of the contributiner, (minimum 100 dollars). In the final i had to put some informations. 

Ex06:

The next i had to make a program that register how many vote each player received, the player was called for your t-shirt number, i had to show: quantity of votes, which player received these votes, and the % of them. In final i had to show the winner.
